## 🔄 Event Hubs - The "Big Data Pipe"

### 🎯 When to Choose Event Hubs
- ✅ **Millions of events per second**
- ✅ **Massive IoT telemetry**
- ✅ **Centralized log aggregation**
- ✅ **Data ingestion** for analytics
- ✅ **Stream processing** upstream

### 📊 Typical AZ-305 Use Cases
```
• 100,000 IoT sensors → Event Hubs → Analytics
• Application logs → Event Hubs → Data Lake
• Real-time metrics → Event Hubs → Dashboards
• Gaming telemetry → Event Hubs → ML Pipeline
```

### 🔧 Technical Deep-Dive

#### Partitioning Strategy
- **32 partitions max** per Event Hub

- **Auto-inflate**: Dynamic scaling up to 20 TUs

#### Event Hubs Capture
```
Event Hubs → Automatic capture → Blob/ADLS
• Avro format for schema evolution
• Time/size-based triggers
• No code required for archival
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategies

### Event Hubs Cost Optimization
```
Strategies:
• Right-size throughput units based on usage patterns

• Consider dedicated clusters for predictable workloads

Cost model:
• Standard: $0.028/million events + TU cost
• Dedicated: Fixed monthly cost regardless of usage
```

### Stream Analytics Cost Optimization
```
SU sizing guidelines:
• 1 SU handles ~1MB/s simple queries
• Complex queries (joins, UDFs) need more SUs
• Monitor SU utilization to avoid over-provisioning

Cost reduction:
• Start/stop jobs for development environments
• Use temporal queries efficiently
• Minimize cross-partition operations
```

### Service Bus Cost Optimization
```
Tier selection:
• Basic: Simple queues only
• Standard: Topics, sessions, transactions
• Premium: Dedicated resources, VNet integration

Optimization tips:
• Batch operations where possible
• Use appropriate message retention periods
• Monitor message size (impacts throughput)

## 💡 Final Tips for AZ-305 Success

### Study Approach
1. **Hands-on Practice**: Deploy each service in Azure
2. **Scenario Mapping**: Create mental models for each pattern
3. **Cost Awareness**: Understand pricing implications
4. **Integration Focus**: How services work together

### Common Exam Traps
- Don't choose the "latest and greatest" - choose what fits
- Consider operational complexity, not just features
- Think about the entire data pipeline, not just one component
- Remember compliance and security requirements

### Last-Minute Review
- Memorize throughput limits and key metrics
- Practice drawing architecture diagrams
- Review anti-patterns and when NOT to use each service
- Understand the decision matrices by heart

**Remember**: The AZ-305 tests your ability to design solutions, not just memorize features. Always think about trade-offs, costs, and real-world constraints!
